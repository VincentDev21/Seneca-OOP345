This milestone overall have been challenging but a great learning experience. The milestone allowed me to put what I have learnt in OOP345.
The project's aim was to simulate an assembly line with multiple stations and customer orders, guiding me through a progressive set of milestones 
that gradually built upon each other. This holistic approach provided a comprehensive understanding of designing and implementing complex systems using object-oriented principles.

Throughout the milestone, the significance of proper class design, encapsulation, and interaction became evident. 
The emphasis on using STL algorithms and incorporating good programming practices, such as exception handling and 
proper memory management, showcased the importance of writing clean, robust, and maintainable code.

The milestone's structure, with sample outputs and tester modules, provided a solid framework for testing 
and validating the implemented functionality. This aspect was particularly insightful, as it demonstrated 
how to thoroughly test complex systems to ensure they meet the desired specifications.

Finally, this program enhanced my grasp of practical software development while also improving my technical skills. 
It provided a window into the difficulties developers encounter when working on such projects by bringing to life 
the complexity required in developing and simulating sophisticated systems. Overall, the milestone was a valuable 
learning opportunity that emphasized the significance of applying theoretical knowledge to real-world situations 
and developing the abilities required for creating well-structured, useful software.
