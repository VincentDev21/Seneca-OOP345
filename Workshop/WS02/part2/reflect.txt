I gained knowledge about file management, object-oriented programming, and timekeeping throughout this workshop. During the workshop, 
I noticed that by using the deep copy method when copying items causes a noticeable time difference between copy and move 
operations. When a object is copied, When an object is copied, a "deep copy" is made, which duplicates all the data members and 
gives them fresh memory. This procedure can take a while, especially when copying intricate data structures or huge items. 
On the other hand, relocating an object entails giving a new object ownership of its resources, which is often quicker because 
it does not need copying any data.

Also in the workshop, I was able to read the input file while utilising file input stream operations in the TennisLog 
constructor to fill the dynamic array. The information is going be kept in memory or a different data structure to 
avoid reading the file again. In the workshop I was also able to experience the use fo the chrono libary.
The chrono library includes the clock types steady_clock and system_clock.  While system_clock represents the 
system-wide real-time clock that is impacted by system time modifications, steady_clock offers a steady and monotonic clock for precise duration measurements.
