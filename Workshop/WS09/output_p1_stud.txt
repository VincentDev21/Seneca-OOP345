C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by 
Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, 
or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly 
over time, and modern C++ has object-oriented, generic, 
and functional features in addition to facilities for 
low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always 
implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide 
C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, 
Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on 
many platforms.

C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and 
embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, 
with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its 
design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many 
other contexts, with key strengths being software 
infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, 
including desktop applications, servers (e.g. e-commerce, 
Web search, or SQL servers), and performance-critical 
applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).

C++ is standardized by the International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version 
ratified and published by ISO in December 2017 as 
ISO/IEC 14882:2017 (informally known as C++17). The C++ 
programming language was initially standardized in 1998 
as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by the 
C++03, C++11 and C++14 standards. The current C++17 
standard supersedes these with new features and an 
enlarged standard library. Before the initial 
standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Danish 
computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs 
since 1979 as an extension of the C language; he 
wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C 
that also provided high-level features for program 
organization. C++20 is the next planned standard, 
keeping with the current trend of a new version every 
three years.

Good Luck!!
